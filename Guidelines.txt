Here we are explaining about combining of two platform one is Unity and second is Android studio.
This is the sample of application which uses unity platform of with its plugin named as Vuforia,
with the help of Vuforia plugin AR Environment was created in which multiple models appear according 
to its respective buttons. Here is a question, how this will work with the help of android studio?
For this here is the answer first we created exported file with the help of unity for android studio,
by which is used as a project file because it does not have gradle.app instead of two gradle there is 
one which is build.gradle(Module:<name>).
Steps for application integration:
1- Export android gradle file form Unity.
2- Click Open Existing project through android studio.
3- create an Activity which you want and make it launcher activity
4- Goto manifest.xml write following code:
	3.1- tools:replace="android:theme"
	3.2- replace = "android:icon" (if needed)
	3.3- android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light"(theme you want)
	3.4- remove intent filter from Unity activity
5- Goto Build.gradle and erase appV7:28.0.0 like code
6- clean project and rebuild
app launched!!
